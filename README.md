# weatherwatch
Website based on information from OpenWeatherMap.org 

Created starter project from https://start.spring.io/

Using `~/.weatherwatch/weatherwatch.properties` to hold sensitive data, such as API key and proxy details.

Signed up to OpenWeatherMap.org and generated an API Key, placed in weatherwatch.properties along with proxy details

    weatherwatch.api.key=0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210
    weatherwatch.http.proxyHost=proxy.example.org
    weatherwatch.http.proxyPort=8080

I've captured these results as "london.json", "hong-kong.json" and "error.json" in src/test/resources/__files for WireMock to serve.


In the `WeatherResult` JSON objects I've used `long` for time stamps as you won't mistake `0L` for a real time stamp, but for temperature and pressure I'm using `Double` and `Integer` to avoid confusion when values are missing. 

I've left temperature in Kelvin at this stage and intend to map to Fahrenheit and Celsius at the presentation stage. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin

    degreesCelsius = degreesKelvin - 273.15
    degreesFahrenheit = (degreesKelvin * 9.0 / 5.0) - 459.67


OpenWeatherMap.org suggests that we only send requests every ten minutes so we need to do some *caching* 

> **How to get accurate API response**

> 1 Do not send requests more then 1 time per 10 minutes from one device/one API key. Normally the weather is not changing so frequently.

> 2 Use the name of the server as api.openweathermap.org. Please never use the IP address of the server.

> 3 Call API by city ID instead of city name, city coordinates or zip code. In this case you get precise respond exactly for your city.

> 4 Free account has limitation of capacity and data availability. If you do not get respond from server do not try to repeat your request immediately, 
> but only after 10 min. Also we recommend to store your previous request data


## TO DO
- Cache/orchestration layer to add timezone data and limit calls to every ten minutes at a time - DONE
- presentation layer - DONE
- Time Zones!
  - today's date in the city time zone - DONE
  - Show sunset and sunrise in the city time zone - DONE
  - Give user the option to show these in their local time zone
  - implement TimeZoneService to call a web service, e.g. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone/intro
- Additional web-level tests including integration tests to show that the cache is doing its work
- It is ugly and uses a static HTML interface 
  - use Bootstrap to make it pretty and JavaScript to make it dynamic
  - implement a RESTful web service interface serving JSON, use Angular, do time zone conversion in browser
- Load and cache city list from OpenWeatherMap.org, type ahead for searching for city, etc.
- Change `Temperature` to use `double` not `BigDecimal` which is a bit overblown - DONE
- lots more tests required
